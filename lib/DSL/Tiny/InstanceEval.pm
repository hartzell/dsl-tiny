=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package provides a simple interface, L</instance_eval>, for evaluating
snippets of a DSL (implemented with L<DSL::Tiny::Role>) with respect to a
particular instance of a class that consumes the role.

=attr _anon_pkg_name

Private attribute, used to set up a package to stash private stuff.

has _anon_pkg_name => (
    is      => 'ro',
    isa     => Str,
    lazy    => 1,

);

    sub _build__anon_pkg_name { ## no critic(ProhibitUnusedPrivateSubroutines)

    }
}

=attr _instance_evalator

PRIVATE

There is no 'u' in _instance_evalator.  That means there should be no
you in there either....

Returns a coderef that is used by the instance_eval() method.

=cut

has _instance_evalator => (
    is       => 'ro',
    isa      => CodeRef,

    init_arg => undef,
);

##
## - set up an environment (anonymous package) in which to execute code that is
##   being instance_eval'ed,
## - push curried closures into the package for each of the closures,
## - and build a coderef that switches to that package, does the eval,
##   dies if the eval had trouble and otherwise returns the eval's return value.

    # stuff an evalator routine into the same package,
    # closed over $pkg_name

}

=method instance_eval

Something kind-a-similar to Ruby's instance_eval.  Takes a string and evaluates
it using eval(), The evaluation happens in a package that has been populated
with a set of functions that map to methods in this class with the instance
curried out.

See the synopsis for an example.

=cut

sub instance_eval {    ## no critic(RequireArgUnpacking)
    my $self = shift;

    return $self->_instance_evalator()->(@_);
}

=requires build_dsl_keywords

Requires build_dsl_keywords, as a proxy for being used in a class that consumes
DSL::Tiny::Role.

=cut

requires qw(build_dsl_keywords);
